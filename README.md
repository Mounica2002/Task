#Points to remember :

● HTML, JS, CSS, and PHP code should be in separate files, none of the 
codes must co-exist in the same file.
● Only use Jquery AJAX for interacting with the backend (strictly no usage 
of form submission).
● CSS can be used but the form must be designed in bootstrap in order to 
maintain page responsiveness.
● Use MySql for storing the registered data and MongoDB for Storing the 
details of the user profiles
● In MySQL always use Prepared Statements, with no usage of simple SQL 
statements.
● The login session should be maintained only using browser localstorage
(Do not use PHP Session)
